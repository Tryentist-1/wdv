**Release Date:** 2025-06-16
**Status:** Released

---

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Ranking Round 2.0!** This is a major update focused on completely overhauling the scoring workflow to better match how scoring is done on the field. Our new "Digital Clipboard" design makes scoring an entire bale of archers faster, more intuitive, and less error-prone.

### âœ¨ Key Features & Enhancements

#### 1. **New! Bale & Target Assignment**
This was a critical missing piece, and we're excited to have it in place.
*   **Set Bale Number:** When you start a new round, you can now set the official Bale Number for the session.
*   **Assign Target Letters:** As you add archers to the bale, you can assign each one a unique target letter (A-H). This information is now displayed on all screens for easy identification.

#### 2. **New! "Verify & Send" Bale Totals via SMS**
We've streamlined the process for exporting and sharing final scores.
*   **Verify First:** After scoring, go to any archer's card to review the full scoresheet.
*   **One-Click Totals:** Click the new **"Verify & Send"** button to see a summary of all archers' totals for the entire bale in a clean pop-up modal.
*   **Send with Confidence:** Once you've confirmed the totals are correct, click **"Send SMS"**. This opens your phone's messaging app with all the data perfectly formatted and ready to be pasted into a Google Sheet.

#### 3. **Improved! UX & Workflow**
*   **Logical "Send" Location:** The "Verify & Send" button is now located on the final card review screen, which is the natural place to verify and export totals.
*   **Cleaner Interface:** We've removed redundant buttons from the main scoring screen to reduce clutter and focus on the core task of entering scores.

### ðŸš€ How to Use the New Workflow

1.  **Setup:** On the "Setup Bale" screen, set your Bale Number and select all the archers who will be shooting on that bale. Assign a Target Letter to each.
2.  **Score:** Use the main "Scoring" screen (the "Digital Clipboard") to enter scores end-by-end for all archers.
3.  **Review:** Tap the `Â»` button next to any archer's name to view their complete, traditional scorecard.
4.  **Verify & Send:** On the scorecard view, tap **"Verify & Send"**. Review the totals for all archers on the bale in the pop-up.
5.  **Confirm & SMS:** Tap **"Send SMS"** to package up the results and send them off.

Thank you for your valuable feedback, which directly led to these improvements. We're confident that Ranking Round 2.0 will make scoring faster and easier for everyone.
