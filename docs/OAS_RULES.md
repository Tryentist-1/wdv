# OAS Archery Tournament Ruleset

This document outlines the common tournament structures and rules for the OAS Archery application.

## 1. Ranking Rounds

All standard events begin with ranking rounds to determine seeding for subsequent elimination brackets.

### Standard Divisions

Ranking rounds are typically separated into four (4) standard divisions:

* Boys Varsity (BV)
* Boys Junior Varsity (BJV)
* Girls Varsity (GV)
* Girls Junior Varsity (GJV)

---

## 2. Standard Tournament Flow (Post-Ranking)

Following the ranking rounds, archers and teams are seeded into single-elimination brackets.

### 2.1. Solo Elimination (Top 8)

* **Participants:** Top 8 individual archers from each division (BV, BJV, GV, GJV) based on ranking round scores.
* **Format:** Quarter-Bracket (8 participants).
* **Competition:** Solo, head-to-head matches.
* **Advancement:** Single elimination. The winner of each match advances; the loser is eliminated.
  * Round 1: Quarterfinals
  * Round 2: Semifinals
  * Round 3: Finals (for 1st/2nd) & Bronze Medal Match (for 3rd/4th)

### 2.2. Team Elimination (Top 8 Schools)

* **Participants:** Top 8 schools based on combined team scores from the ranking rounds.
* **Divisions:**
  * Boys Team
  * Girls Team
* **Format:** Quarter-Bracket (8 teams).
* **Competition:** Head-to-head team matches.
* **Advancement:** Single elimination.

#### Team Eligibility Variants

A common ruleset variant determines how teams are formed:

* **Exclude Solo Shooters:** Team scores are calculated *only* from archers designated as part of a school's team. Individuals competing without a full team ("solo shooters") are not eligible to contribute to a team score.
* **Include Solo Shooters:** Team scores are calculated using the top-scoring archers from a school, *regardless* of whether they were designated as "solo" or "team". This allows individuals to contribute to their school's team score even if they are the only participant from that school.

## 3. Alternate Tournament Formats

On rare occasions, a different tournament structure may be used.

### 3.1. Swiss System

* **Participants:** All archers, competing as individuals (solos).
* **Rounds:** Typically five (5) rounds of competition.
* **Matching:** Archers are paired against opponents they have not yet competed against, ideally with a similar win/loss record or score.
* **Goal:** To determine an overall rating and ranking after all rounds are complete, rather than through direct elimination.

## 4. Overall School Champion Awards (Point System)

Overall school championships (e.g., "State Champions," "National Champions") are determined by a point system. Points are calculated based on a school's performance within each specific division (e.g., "Boys Varsity," "Girls JV").

This system is used for State and National Championships and may be optionally adopted by Conference Championships.

### General Rules (All Point Systems)

* **Division-Specific:** Points are calculated and awarded separately for each division (BV, BJV, GV, GJV).
* **Qualification:** To be eligible for a champion award in a division, a school must field a full team (a minimum of three archers) in that division.
* **Tie-Breaker:** Ties for champion awards are broken by the school with the greater number of 1st place finishes, followed by the number of 2nd place finishes, and then 3rd place finishes.

### 4.1. JV (State) & Nationals (All Divisions) Point System

This system is based *entirely on the Ranking Round results*. Points are awarded from the following four categories:

1.  **Participation:** 1 point per archer, up to a maximum of **8 points**.

    * 1st Place: 8 points
    * 2nd Place: 6 points
    * 3rd Place: 4 points

4.  **Team Combined Score:** Points for the top 4 schools based on the combined ranking round score of their top 3 archers:
    * 1st Place: 8 points
