  - **Mobile Responsive:** Optimized spacing and layout for iPhone XR, iPhone SE, Samsung, Safari mobile.
  - **Tailwind Alignment:** Removed exclamation point indicator, ensured all styling uses Tailwind utilities.
  - **Column Configuration:** Updated from 6 columns to 4 columns (Assignment, Status, Progress, Type).

### ✅ Previous Fixes (Nov 29, 2025)

- **Scorecard Colors:** Fixed CSS regression where score colors (Gold, Red, Blue, etc.) were not showing.
  - **Cause:** `.score-input` class had `background-color: transparent` overriding Tailwind classes.
  - **Fix:** Removed conflicting style and ensured `tokens.css` is loaded.
- **Localhost "No Event Code" Modal:** Fixed modal appearing on fresh loads in local dev.
- **Live Updates Errors:** Clarified that 401 errors on localhost are expected and handled gracefully.
- **Tailwind System:** Completed integration by adding `tokens.css` (CSS variables) and removing legacy `score-colors.css`.

### ⚠️ Known Issues / Recent Fixes

- **Resume Ranking Round from Open Assignments (index.html):**
  - **Status:** ✅ **Implemented and working for ranking rounds created via events with entry codes.**
  - **Flow:**  
    1. Archer sets themselves via **Archer Details** (archer list).  
    2. `index.html` loads **Your Open Assignments** by calling `GET /api/v1/archers/{archerId}/history`.  
    3. The **“Resume Ranking Round”** row links directly to `ranking_round_300.html?event={eventId}&round={roundId}&archer={archerId}`.  
    4. `handleDirectLink()` in `js/ranking_round_300.js` now:
       - fetches the event snapshot to get the **entry_code**,  
       - fetches the round snapshot to find the archer’s **baleNumber**,  
       - fetches full bale data, reconstructs `state.archers` and scores,  
       - saves `current_bale_session` + `event_entry_code`,  
       - and switches `state.currentView` → **`scoring`**.
  - **Bug fixed:** A `ReferenceError` (`setArcherCookie is not defined`) was causing an alert **“Failed to load round. Please try again.”** and dropping the user back into Setup. This is now fixed by using a safe helper (`setArcherCookieSafe`) and letting `handleDirectLink()` complete the transition to the in‑progress score card.
  - **Remaining edge cases:** If the server snapshot does **not** contain a bale assignment for the archer, `handleDirectLink()` intentionally routes to **Setup** so the archer can pick bale mates and then continue scoring on the existing round.

---

### 📋 BACKLOG (Planned but Not Active)

**Note:** These are planned improvements but not currently being worked on. Prioritize based on user needs and sprint goals.

- **Headers and Footers:** Update headers and footers in scoring modules (Ranking Round 300, Ranking Round 360, Solo Card, Team Card) for consistency and improved UX
- **Complete Checkbox:** Add "Complete" checkbox to scorecards so archers can mark in-progress cards as complete
  - This will help archers signal when they've finished scoring a round/match
  - Should integrate with existing status system (PEND → COMP transition)
  - UI placement: Consider adding to card view header or footer area
- **Bracket Generation Bug:** Fix bracket generation from Top 8 ranking results
  - Issue: Bracket generation endpoint (`POST /v1/brackets/{id}/generate`) does not properly generate brackets from Top 8 archers/teams
  - Location: `api/index.php` - `/v1/brackets/:id/generate` endpoint
  - Priority: High (blocks tournament progression from ranking rounds to elimination brackets)
- **Results Dark Mode Bug:** Fix dark mode display issues in results view
  - Issue: Dark mode styling not working correctly in results page
  - Location: `results.html` or related CSS/JS
  - Priority: Medium (affects user experience in dark mode)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack at a Glance

### Frontend

- **Vanilla JS** (no framework - intentional)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling) - ✅ 100% migrated (Nov 2025)
- **Mobile-first** (99% phone usage [[memory:10705663]])
- **No legacy CSS** - All modules use Tailwind exclusively

### Backend

- **PHP 8.0+** (RESTful API)
- **MySQL 8.0+** (primary database)

### Key Modules

- `js/live_updates.js` - API client + offline queue
- `js/common.js` - Shared utilities (cookies, etc)
- `js/archer_module.js` - Roster management
- `js/coach.js` - Coach console
- `api/index.php` - API router
- `api/db.php` - Database + auth layer

### Storage Pattern

```javascript
DATABASE (MySQL)
  └─ Source of truth for all competition data

localStorage
  └─ Cache + session state + offline queue

Cookies
  └─ Persistent identification (archer ID, coach auth)
```

---

## 🔑 Key Principles (Do NOT Violate)

### 1. Mobile-First Always

- 99% usage on phones [[memory:10705663]]
- Test on small screens (iPhone SE)
- Touch-friendly targets
- Simple, fast UX

### 2. Database is Source of Truth

- All competition scores → MySQL
- localStorage = cache only
- Offline queue for sync
- Never rely on localStorage for permanent data

### 3. Verification Workflow is Sacred

- Coach must verify before finalization
- Locking prevents tampering
- Event closure is permanent
- Full audit trail required

### 4. IDs Use GUIDs (Not Sequential Numbers)

- Use UUIDs for all IDs [[memory:10706370]]
- No sequential numbering in IDs
- Prevents guessing/enumeration

### 5. Coach is Gatekeeper

- Coach controls events
- Coach verifies scores
- Coach closes events
- Coach uses results for decisions

## 🤝 AI Collaboration Approach

**When working in Cursor/IDE, focus on two mindsets:**

### 🔧 Dev Lead Mindset (Implementation)

**Apply when:** Building features, refactoring, architecting

**Key Focus:**

- **Technical Feasibility** - Can this be built? What's the complexity?
- **Follow Proven Patterns** - Ranking Round is your template, copy that approach
- **Modular & Maintainable** - Break into components, keep DRY
- **Design for Testability** - Can this be easily tested?
- **Translate Requirements → Code** - Turn user needs into technical specs

**Questions to Ask:**

- "How does this integrate with existing systems?"
- "What's the data model?"
- "Are there edge cases I'm missing?"
- "How will this perform at scale?"

---

### 🧪 QA Lead Mindset (Quality & Testing)

**Apply when:** Reviewing code, before commits, planning features

**Key Focus:**

- **Test Before Production** - All changes reviewed with testing in mind
- **Incremental & Safe** - Break big changes into small, testable pieces
- **Edge Cases & Errors** - What can go wrong? What if inputs are invalid?
- **No Regressions** - Will this break existing functionality?
- **Validate Against Requirements** - Does this meet acceptance criteria?

**Questions to Ask:**

- "What's the test plan for this?"
- "How do we verify this works?"
- "What happens if this fails?"
- "Did we test on mobile?"
- "Can we break this into smaller changes?"

---

### 💡 Switching Mindsets

**During implementation:** Lead with Dev mindset, check with QA mindset

```
1. Feature request arrives
2. Dev: "Here's how we build it..." (design & implement)
3. QA: "Here's how we test it..." (test plan)
4. Dev: Implement with tests in mind
5. QA: Review before commit
6. Commit only when both mindsets satisfied
```

**Before every commit:**

- ✅ Dev: "Is this well-architected?"
- ✅ QA: "Is this tested/testable?"
- ✅ Both: "Does this solve the user problem?"

---

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Start PHP server
npm run serve
# → http://localhost:3000

---

### ✅ Sprint 3: Solo Module Integration (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Refactor Solo module to use database

**Status:** ✅ Complete - See Sprint 3 section above

**Tasks:**

1. [ ] Refactor `js/solo_card.js` to use API
2. [ ] Add event code authentication
3. [ ] Add offline sync queue
4. [ ] Add verification UI
5. [ ] Integrate with coach console

---

### Sprint 4: Team Module Integration (AFTER Sprint 3)

**Goal:** Refactor Team module to use database

**Tasks:** (Same pattern as Solo)

**Estimated:** 10-12 hours

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Sequential IDs** - Use GUIDs/UUIDs [[memory:10706370]]
2. **Skip Verification** - Every module needs verification workflow
3. **localStorage as Primary** - Database is source of truth
4. **Desktop-first Design** - Mobile is 99% of usage
5. **Break Existing Code** - Ranking Rounds work perfectly, don't touch
6. **Complex Frameworks** - Keep it simple, vanilla JS
7. **Ignore Locking** - Security through lock mechanism is critical

### ✅ Do This Instead

1. **UUIDs everywhere** - Archer IDs, Event IDs, Round IDs
2. **Follow Ranking Round pattern** - It's proven and working
3. **Database first, cache second** - localStorage is temporary
4. **Test on phone** - Real device testing required
5. **Add, don't replace** - Additive changes only
6. **Keep it simple** - No unnecessary complexity
7. **Implement locking** - Verification workflow is non-negotiable

## 💬 Session Start Template

**Use this when starting a new AI session:**

```
Hi! I'm working on the WDV Archery Suite. Quick context:

📋 CURRENT STATE:
- Version: v1.8.0 (December 2025)
- Phase: Phase 2.5 - Event Tracking Dashboard (Planning)
- Status: [In Progress / Planning / Testing]

🎯 TODAY'S GOAL:
[What you want to accomplish in this session]

📝 WHAT CHANGED SINCE LAST SESSION:
[Brief summary of what was done last time, or "First session"]

📂 FILES/MODULES WE'RE WORKING ON:
- [List specific files or modules]

❓ QUESTION/TASK:
[Your specific question or task]

🔧 CONTEXT:
[Any additional context: constraints, requirements, edge cases, etc.]

📚 I'VE READ:
- ✅ SESSION_QUICK_START.md
- ✅ BALE_GROUP_SCORING_WORKFLOW.md
- [ ] APP_ARCHITECTURE_AND_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md (relevant sections)
- [ ] [Other relevant docs]
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Gives LLM immediate context about current state
- ✅ Clearly states what you want to accomplish
- ✅ Highlights what changed (helps LLM understand recent work)
- ✅ Lists files/modules (helps LLM focus on relevant code)
- ✅ Separates question from context (clearer structure)

**Pro Tip:** Copy this template into a note file and update it after each session. Then paste it at the start of the next session!
