## 🚨 Status Update (February 2026)

### ✅ Solo/Team Keypad & Sync Fixes (February 12, 2026)
- **Solo keypad fix:** Migrated `solo_card.js` from inline keypad to shared `ScoreKeypad` module (`js/score_keypad.js`). Fixed keypad not appearing and auto-advance broken on mobile (caused by `readOnly` check in `focusin` handler).
- **Match code restoration:** `hydrateSoloMatch()` and `hydrateTeamMatch()` now restore `match_code` from server GET response. Fixes 401 sync failures after "Reset Data" clears localStorage.
- **Sync status on solo card:** End rows now embed sync status icons (checkmark/spinner/error) via `<span id="sync-e${setNumber}">`.
- **LiveUpdates API:** Added `setSoloMatchCode()` and `setTeamMatchCode()` public setters.

### ✅ Deploy Script & Safety Overhaul (February 12, 2026)
- **Comprehensive exclusions:** `DeployFTP.sh` now has 40+ exclude patterns organized by category (sensitive files, IDE/tooling, dev dirs, test configs, API dev tools, etc.)
- **Canonical whitelist:** `.cursor/rules/deployment-safety.mdc` now starts with a positive "What DOES Deploy" list — no more guessing.
- **Step 3 verification:** Deploy script now accurately shows only production files (was previously showing dev files in the preview).
- **Files now excluded that were previously leaking to prod:** `scripts/`, `audit/`, `bugs/`, `planning/`, `jest.config.js`, `playwright.config*`, `package.json`, `api/sql/**`, `api/seed_*.php`, `api/*migrate*.php`, build configs, dot files, and more.

### ✅ Games Events: Position Filter & Import Roster Games
- **Position filter:** S1–S8, T1–T6 for Games Events in Add Archers modal
- **Import Roster Games:** CSV import with column mapping, MySQL sync
- **Assignment list:** Active/Inactive/All filter, sort by School → Gender → VJV → Position
- **Deploy safety:** Excludes `.cursor`, `.agent`, `config.local.php`; `WDV_DEPLOY_SOURCE` env var
- **Config:** `config.local.php.example`, `docs/CONFIG_SETUP.md`, prod cleanup guides

**Items left:** [docs/planning/ITEMS_LEFT_TO_COMPLETE.md](docs/planning/ITEMS_LEFT_TO_COMPLETE.md)

**Open (when convenient):**
- **Local PHP 8.5 vs prod 8.3:** Downgrade local to 8.3 to match prod (prod is capped at 8.3 in control panel). Reduces "works on my machine" surprises. Not blocking.

### ✅ Ranking Round Sync Fixes (February 3, 2026)

- **Header:** Single alert — LOCAL Only (red) / Syncing (yellow) / Synced (green). Removed “Check server”; automatic background comparison with server.
- **Footer:** Sync End validated (missing-arrow check), “All Arrows Synced” or “Error [desc]” feedback, event delegation so button always fires. Running total = sum of complete ends 1..current.
- **Missing Arrow** indicator in scoring table and scorecard view (placeholder “Missing” + dashed border).
- **Style guide:** Preference added — headers for information and alerts only; actions in footer or content. See `tests/components/style-guide.html` → Headers & Layouts.

**Note:** Server setup (Docker, MySQL, PHP) is unchanged and separate from these sync optimizations. See `QUICK_START_LOCAL.md` → “Ranking Round Sync” for details.

---

## 🚨 Status Update (January 26, 2026)

### ✅ Docker Environment Integration
- **Feature:** Added full Docker Compose support for local development (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Components:** Nginx (Web), PHP-FPM 8.2 (App), MariaDB 10.6 (Database)
- **Configuration:** 
  - `nginx.conf` with PATH_INFO support for API routing
  - `config.docker.php` with environment-specific credentials
  - `package.json` scripts: `docker:up`, `docker:down`, `docker:logs`
- **Documentation:** Updated `README.md`, `QUICK_START_LOCAL.md`, and `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
- **Status:** Verified and working. Database seeded with production backup.

### ⚠️ Known Issues / Recent Fixes

- **Resume Ranking Round from Open Assignments (index.html):**
  - **Status:** 🔧 **In Progress - Debugging resume flow bugs**
  - **Current Issues:**
    1. **"Open Assignments" showing incorrect data:**
       - **Bug:** Shows rounds for all archers instead of only pending rounds for the selected archer's UUID
       - **Expected:** Only show rounds where `round_archers.archer_id` matches the selected archer
       - **Root Cause:** History API query may not be filtering correctly, or frontend not filtering by archer
    2. **Resume not selecting correct archers:**
       - **Bug:** Clicking resume on different rounds shows the same set of archers
       - **Expected:** Each round should load its own unique set of archers from that round's score card group
       - **Root Cause:** Possible state pollution or wrong roundId being used when fetching archers
    3. **Standalone rounds defaulting to Bale 1:**
       - **Design Flaw:** When creating standalone rounds, archers often leave bale as Bale 1, making restoration difficult
       - **Impact:** Multiple standalone rounds all on Bale 1 makes it impossible to distinguish which archers belong to which round
       - **Potential Fix:** Require bale selection or auto-assign unique bale numbers for standalone rounds
    4. **Standalone rounds with null event_id:**
       - **Design Flaw:** Standalone rounds have `event_id = NULL`, which can cause dirty data and filtering issues
       - **Expected:** Standalone rounds should have a special event code value (e.g., "Standalone") instead of null
       - **Impact:** Makes it difficult to filter and display standalone rounds correctly
  - **Recent Fixes:**
    - ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout resume flow
    - ✅ Fixed state clearing to prevent pollution between rounds
    - ✅ Implemented snapshot merge logic to include all archers (not just bale-specific)
    - ✅ Added roundId verification to ensure correct round is loaded
    - ✅ Created cleanup scripts for orphaned `round_archers` entries
  - **Next Steps:**
    - Fix history API filtering to only return rounds for selected archer
    - Verify roundId is correctly used throughout resume flow
    - Address standalone round bale assignment design
    - Update standalone rounds to use "Standalone" event code

## 🎯 Next Steps (Upcoming Work)

### 🔥 ACTIVE WORK (Current Sprint)

#### 📋 Event Tracking Dashboard

**Status:** Planning & Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Goal:** Create holistic event overview for day-of-event management

**Features:**
- Real-time progress tracking across all rounds and brackets
- Visual hierarchy: Event → Rounds → Brackets
- Completion percentages and status indicators
- Quick access to critical actions (Verify, View Results, Create Brackets)
- Timeline/schedule view for multi-day events
- Mobile-optimized for on-the-go event management

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Additive only** - New page (`event_dashboard.html`) and API endpoint
- **No impact on existing features** - Standalone dashboard
- **Follows existing patterns** - Uses same API structure, Tailwind CSS, mobile-first

**Documentation:**
- [EVENT_TRACKING_DETAILS_ENHANCEMENT_EVALUATION.md](docs/EVENT_TRACKING_DETAILS_ENHANCEMENT_EVALUATION.md)

**Estimated Effort:** 6-10 weeks (phased approach)

---

### 📋 BACKLOG (Planned but Not Active)

**Note:** These are planned improvements but not currently being worked on. Prioritize based on user needs and sprint goals.

- ✅ **Archer Edit Modal Scroll/Touch Fixes (v1.9.6):** ✅ Complete - Fixed critical scroll and touch issues
  - Fixed background scrolling when modal is open
  - Implemented body scroll lock
  - Added touch event prevention on overlay
  - Added scroll containment CSS
  - Evaluated modal paradigm (confirmed appropriate)
  - Created evaluation documentation
- **Headers and Footers:** Update headers and footers in scoring modules (Ranking Round 300, Ranking Round 360, Solo Card, Team Card) for consistency and improved UX
- **Complete Checkbox:** Add "Complete" checkbox to scorecards so archers can mark in-progress cards as complete
  - This will help archers signal when they've finished scoring a round/match
  - Should integrate with existing status system (PEND → COMP transition)
  - UI placement: Consider adding to card view header or footer area
- **Bracket Generation Bug:** Fix bracket generation from Top 8 ranking results
  - Issue: Bracket generation endpoint (`POST /v1/brackets/{id}/generate`) does not properly generate brackets from Top 8 archers/teams
  - Location: `api/index.php` - `/v1/brackets/:id/generate` endpoint
  - Priority: High (blocks tournament progression from ranking rounds to elimination brackets)
- **Results Dark Mode Bug:** Fix dark mode display issues in results view
  - Issue: Dark mode styling not working correctly in results page
  - Location: `results.html` or related CSS/JS
  - Priority: Medium (affects user experience in dark mode)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack at a Glance

### Frontend

- **Vanilla JS** (no framework - intentional)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling) - ✅ 100% migrated (Nov 2025)
- **Mobile-first** (99% phone usage [[memory:10705663]])
- **No legacy CSS** - All modules use Tailwind exclusively
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Installable, offline-capable (v1.8.3+)

### Backend

- **PHP 8.0+** (RESTful API)
- **MySQL 8.0+** (primary database)

### Key Modules

- `js/live_updates.js` - API client + offline queue
- `js/common.js` - Shared utilities (cookies, etc)
- `js/archer_module.js` - Roster management
- `js/coach.js` - Coach console
- `api/index.php` - API router
- `api/db.php` - Database + auth layer
- `sw.js` - Service worker for PWA caching (v1.8.3+)
- `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA (v1.8.3+)

### Storage Pattern

```javascript
DATABASE (MySQL)
  └─ Source of truth for all competition data

localStorage
  └─ Cache + session state + offline queue

Cookies
  └─ Persistent identification (archer ID, coach auth)
```

---

## 🔑 Key Principles (Do NOT Violate)

### 1. Mobile-First Always

- 99% usage on phones [[memory:10705663]]
- Test on small screens (iPhone SE)
- Touch-friendly targets
- Simple, fast UX

### 2. Database is Source of Truth

- All competition scores → MySQL
- localStorage = cache only
- Offline queue for sync
- Never rely on localStorage for permanent data

### 3. Verification Workflow is Sacred

- Coach must verify before finalization
- Locking prevents tampering
- Event closure is permanent
- Full audit trail required

### 4. IDs Use GUIDs (Not Sequential Numbers)

- Use UUIDs for all IDs [[memory:10706370]]
- No sequential numbering in IDs
- Prevents guessing/enumeration

### 5. Coach is Gatekeeper

- Coach controls events
- Coach verifies scores
- Coach closes events
- Coach uses results for decisions

## 🤝 AI Collaboration Approach

**When working in Cursor/IDE, focus on two mindsets:**

### 🔧 Dev Lead Mindset (Implementation)

**Apply when:** Building features, refactoring, architecting

**Key Focus:**

- **Technical Feasibility** - Can this be built? What's the complexity?
- **Follow Proven Patterns** - Ranking Round is your template, copy that approach
- **Modular & Maintainable** - Break into components, keep DRY
- **Design for Testability** - Can this be easily tested?
- **Translate Requirements → Code** - Turn user needs into technical specs

**Questions to Ask:**

- "How does this integrate with existing systems?"
- "What's the data model?"
- "Are there edge cases I'm missing?"
- "How will this perform at scale?"

---

### 🧪 QA Lead Mindset (Quality & Testing)

**Apply when:** Reviewing code, before commits, planning features

**Key Focus:**

- **Test Before Production** - All changes reviewed with testing in mind
- **Incremental & Safe** - Break big changes into small, testable pieces
- **Edge Cases & Errors** - What can go wrong? What if inputs are invalid?
- **No Regressions** - Will this break existing functionality?
- **Validate Against Requirements** - Does this meet acceptance criteria?

**Questions to Ask:**

- "What's the test plan for this?"
- "How do we verify this works?"
- "What happens if this fails?"
- "Did we test on mobile?"
- "Can we break this into smaller changes?"

---

### 💡 Switching Mindsets

**During implementation:** Lead with Dev mindset, check with QA mindset

```
1. Feature request arrives
2. Dev: "Here's how we build it..." (design & implement)
3. QA: "Here's how we test it..." (test plan)
4. Dev: Implement with tests in mind
5. QA: Review before commit
6. Commit only when both mindsets satisfied
```

**Before every commit:**

- ✅ Dev: "Is this well-architected?"
- ✅ QA: "Is this tested/testable?"
- ✅ Both: "Does this solve the user problem?"

---

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Start PHP server
npm run serve
# → http://localhost:3000

# Run tests
npm test

# Check linting
npm run lint
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: description"
git commit -m "fix: description"
git commit -m "docs: description"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Deployment Workflow

**IMPORTANT FOR LLMs:** When asked to "promote to prod", "deploy to production", or "FTP deploy", follow this complete workflow:

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist

```bash
# 1. Build Tailwind CSS (if any styling changes)
npm run build:css:prod

# 2. Run tests (optional but recommended)
npm test                    # Remote tests
npm run test:local          # Local tests (if server running)

# 3. Preview deployment (dry run)
npm run deploy:dry
```

#### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Primary deployment script location: scripts/deploy/DeployFTP.sh
npm run deploy              # Full deploy with local backup
npm run deploy:fast         # Skip local backup (faster)

# The script automatically:
# ✅ Creates local backup (unless --no-local-backup)
# ✅ Shows files to be uploaded
# ✅ Uploads changed files via FTP-SSL
# ✅ Purges Cloudflare cache (if credentials in .env)
```

#### Available Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without deploying |
| `--reset` | Force re-upload all files, delete remote orphans |
| `--no-local-backup` | Skip local backup (faster) |
| `--remote-backup` | Download remote backup before deploying |

#### What Gets Deployed

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Sequential IDs** - Use GUIDs/UUIDs [[memory:10706370]]
2. **Skip Verification** - Every module needs verification workflow
3. **localStorage as Primary** - Database is source of truth
4. **Desktop-first Design** - Mobile is 99% of usage
5. **Break Existing Code** - Ranking Rounds work perfectly, don't touch
6. **Complex Frameworks** - Keep it simple, vanilla JS
7. **Ignore Locking** - Security through lock mechanism is critical

### ✅ Do This Instead

1. **UUIDs everywhere** - Archer IDs, Event IDs, Round IDs
2. **Follow Ranking Round pattern** - It's proven and working
3. **Database first, cache second** - localStorage is temporary
4. **Test on phone** - Real device testing required
5. **Add, don't replace** - Additive changes only
6. **Keep it simple** - No unnecessary complexity
7. **Implement locking** - Verification workflow is non-negotiable
