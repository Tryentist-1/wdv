### ⚠️ Known Issues / Recent Fixes

- **Resume Ranking Round from Open Assignments (index.html):**
  - **Status:** 🔧 **In Progress - Debugging resume flow bugs**
  - **Current Issues:**
    1. **"Open Assignments" showing incorrect data:**
       - **Bug:** Shows rounds for all archers instead of only pending rounds for the selected archer's UUID
       - **Expected:** Only show rounds where `round_archers.archer_id` matches the selected archer
       - **Root Cause:** History API query may not be filtering correctly, or frontend not filtering by archer
    2. **Resume not selecting correct archers:**
       - **Bug:** Clicking resume on different rounds shows the same set of archers
       - **Expected:** Each round should load its own unique set of archers from that round's score card group
       - **Root Cause:** Possible state pollution or wrong roundId being used when fetching archers
    3. **Standalone rounds defaulting to Bale 1:**
       - **Design Flaw:** When creating standalone rounds, archers often leave bale as Bale 1, making restoration difficult
       - **Impact:** Multiple standalone rounds all on Bale 1 makes it impossible to distinguish which archers belong to which round
       - **Potential Fix:** Require bale selection or auto-assign unique bale numbers for standalone rounds
    4. **Standalone rounds with null event_id:**
       - **Design Flaw:** Standalone rounds have `event_id = NULL`, which can cause dirty data and filtering issues
       - **Expected:** Standalone rounds should have a special event code value (e.g., "Standalone") instead of null
       - **Impact:** Makes it difficult to filter and display standalone rounds correctly
  - **Recent Fixes:**
    - ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout resume flow
    - ✅ Fixed state clearing to prevent pollution between rounds
    - ✅ Implemented snapshot merge logic to include all archers (not just bale-specific)
    - ✅ Added roundId verification to ensure correct round is loaded
    - ✅ Created cleanup scripts for orphaned `round_archers` entries
  - **Next Steps:**
    - Fix history API filtering to only return rounds for selected archer
    - Verify roundId is correctly used throughout resume flow
    - Address standalone round bale assignment design
    - Update standalone rounds to use "Standalone" event code

## 🏗️ Tech Stack at a Glance

### Frontend

- **Vanilla JS** (no framework - intentional)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling) - ✅ 100% migrated (Nov 2025)
- **Mobile-first** (99% phone usage [[memory:10705663]])
- **No legacy CSS** - All modules use Tailwind exclusively
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Installable, offline-capable (v1.8.3+)

### Backend

- **PHP 8.0+** (RESTful API)
- **MySQL 8.0+** (primary database)

### Key Modules

- `js/live_updates.js` - API client + offline queue
- `js/common.js` - Shared utilities (cookies, etc)
- `js/archer_module.js` - Roster management
- `js/coach.js` - Coach console
- `api/index.php` - API router
- `api/db.php` - Database + auth layer
- `sw.js` - Service worker for PWA caching (v1.8.3+)
- `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA (v1.8.3+)

### Storage Pattern

```javascript
DATABASE (MySQL)
  └─ Source of truth for all competition data

localStorage
  └─ Cache + session state + offline queue

Cookies
  └─ Persistent identification (archer ID, coach auth)
```

---

## 🔑 Key Principles (Do NOT Violate)

### 1. Mobile-First Always

- 99% usage on phones [[memory:10705663]]
- Test on small screens (iPhone SE)
- Touch-friendly targets
- Simple, fast UX

### 2. Database is Source of Truth

- All competition scores → MySQL
- localStorage = cache only
- Offline queue for sync
- Never rely on localStorage for permanent data

### 3. Verification Workflow is Sacred

- Coach must verify before finalization
- Locking prevents tampering
- Event closure is permanent
- Full audit trail required

### 4. IDs Use GUIDs (Not Sequential Numbers)

- Use UUIDs for all IDs [[memory:10706370]]
- No sequential numbering in IDs
- Prevents guessing/enumeration

### 5. Coach is Gatekeeper

- Coach controls events
- Coach verifies scores
- Coach closes events
- Coach uses results for decisions

## 🤝 AI Collaboration Approach

**When working in Cursor/IDE, focus on two mindsets:**

### 🔧 Dev Lead Mindset (Implementation)

**Apply when:** Building features, refactoring, architecting

**Key Focus:**

- **Technical Feasibility** - Can this be built? What's the complexity?
- **Follow Proven Patterns** - Ranking Round is your template, copy that approach
- **Modular & Maintainable** - Break into components, keep DRY
- **Design for Testability** - Can this be easily tested?
- **Translate Requirements → Code** - Turn user needs into technical specs

**Questions to Ask:**

- "How does this integrate with existing systems?"
- "What's the data model?"
- "Are there edge cases I'm missing?"
- "How will this perform at scale?"

---

### 🧪 QA Lead Mindset (Quality & Testing)

**Apply when:** Reviewing code, before commits, planning features

**Key Focus:**

- **Test Before Production** - All changes reviewed with testing in mind
- **Incremental & Safe** - Break big changes into small, testable pieces
- **Edge Cases & Errors** - What can go wrong? What if inputs are invalid?
- **No Regressions** - Will this break existing functionality?
- **Validate Against Requirements** - Does this meet acceptance criteria?

**Questions to Ask:**

- "What's the test plan for this?"
- "How do we verify this works?"
- "What happens if this fails?"
- "Did we test on mobile?"
- "Can we break this into smaller changes?"

---

### 💡 Switching Mindsets

**During implementation:** Lead with Dev mindset, check with QA mindset

```
1. Feature request arrives
2. Dev: "Here's how we build it..." (design & implement)
3. QA: "Here's how we test it..." (test plan)
4. Dev: Implement with tests in mind
5. QA: Review before commit
6. Commit only when both mindsets satisfied
```

**Before every commit:**

- ✅ Dev: "Is this well-architected?"
- ✅ QA: "Is this tested/testable?"
- ✅ Both: "Does this solve the user problem?"

---

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Start PHP server
npm run serve

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Sequential IDs** - Use GUIDs/UUIDs [[memory:10706370]]
2. **Skip Verification** - Every module needs verification workflow
3. **localStorage as Primary** - Database is source of truth
4. **Desktop-first Design** - Mobile is 99% of usage
5. **Break Existing Code** - Ranking Rounds work perfectly, don't touch
6. **Complex Frameworks** - Keep it simple, vanilla JS
7. **Ignore Locking** - Security through lock mechanism is critical

### ✅ Do This Instead

1. **UUIDs everywhere** - Archer IDs, Event IDs, Round IDs
2. **Follow Ranking Round pattern** - It's proven and working
3. **Database first, cache second** - localStorage is temporary
4. **Test on phone** - Real device testing required
5. **Add, don't replace** - Additive changes only
6. **Keep it simple** - No unnecessary complexity
7. **Implement locking** - Verification workflow is non-negotiable

When Terry says... | He means...
---|---
**"Bale group"** | 4 archers shooting together (3-9 possible)
**"Digital scorer"** | The ONE archer entering all scores in app
**"Lock the card"** | Mark scorecard as verified and read-only

**"Verify"** | Coach cross-checks paper vs digital and locks
**"VOID"** | Incomplete scorecard marked invalid
**"VER badge"** | Visual indicator of verified/locked scorecard
**"Round archer"** | Individual scorecard (one per archer per round)
**"Entry code"** | Event-specific code for archer authentication
**"Coach passcode"** | Static admin code for coach authentication
**"Top 8"** | Top 8 archers/teams advance to elimination brackets (see [OAS_RULES.md](docs/OAS_RULES.md))
