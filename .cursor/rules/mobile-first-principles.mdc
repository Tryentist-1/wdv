# Mobile-First Design Principles

**CRITICAL:** 99% of users access this application on mobile devices (phones). All design decisions must prioritize mobile experience first.

## Core Requirements

1. **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements must be at least 44px × 44px
2. **Screen Size:** Test on iPhone SE (smallest common screen) before larger screens
3. **Simple UX:** Keep interfaces simple and fast - avoid complex interactions
4. **Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind responsive classes (mobile-first breakpoints)
5. **Performance:** Optimize for slow networks and lower-end devices

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use Tailwind's mobile-first utilities: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` only when necessary
- Default styles should work on mobile, then enhance for larger screens
- Avoid hover states that are critical for functionality (use tap targets)
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Keep modals and overlays mobile-friendly with proper scrolling
