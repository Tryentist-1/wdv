# Git Workflow

## Branch Naming

**Pattern:** `[type]/[description]`

Types:
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/standalone-round-stranded-cards`)
- `vibe/` - Feature development (e.g., `vibe/mobile-landing-page`)
- `feature/` - Major features

## Safe Development Practices

1. **Always create a branch** before making changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/description
   ```

2. **Commit often** - Think of commits as save points:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear description of what changed"
   ```

3. **Check status frequently:**
   ```bash
   git status  # See what branch and what files changed
   ```

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Explain WHAT changed and WHY (if not obvious)
- Reference issue numbers or features when applicable

Good examples:
- "Add coach-only extended profile fields for USA Archery reporting"
- "Fix modal button visibility in dark mode"
- "Ensure expanded sections persist when navigating archers"

## Before Deployment

- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Branch is up to date with base branch
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)
