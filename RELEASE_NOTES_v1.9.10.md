# Release Notes v1.9.10

## Fixes
- **Duplicate Team Rosters**: Fixed an issue where the bracket leaderboard would display identical team rosters for multiple teams from the same school. The system now correctly tracks and displays teams individually based on their specific match history.
- **Missing Archers**: Resolved cases where archers might be missing from the team leaderboard display due to grouping errors.
